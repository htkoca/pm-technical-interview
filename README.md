# Plastic Mobile Technical Test

Complete tasks as per [Instructions PDF](https://github.com/htkoca/pm-technical-interview/blob/master/UI%20Dev%20test.pdf):
- Since the scope of work is injectable and also very small, I've elected to omit external JS libraries like jquery, vue; all code is native js.

### Task 1 - Video Demo

- [Visit Video Demo](https://htkoca.github.io/pm-technical-interview/video-demo/)
